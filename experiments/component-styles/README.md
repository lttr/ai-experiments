# AI Experiment: Component styles

## Purpose

Help to kickstart component styles with a given design. Project already has its
styles, either CSS or Tailwind. Also has some rules for the design and for the
code.

For the purpose of this experiment, all the context will come from the prompt.
You are supposed to provide the CSS or Tailwind config, example component or a
set of conventions in the prompt.

As an input I choose a component from 23rd section of the
[Tailblocks](https://tailblocks.cc/) project. It is not super simple but also
not too complex.

I don't expect to have any behavior, accessibility, or other aspects of a
component, I would rather only focus on the design in this experiment.

## Challenges

Ideally we want styles that are systematic, consistent, responsive, modern, etc.

## Task

Generate styles for a component given an image with the component design.

## Approach

I will use my CSS library and Tailwind to generate the styles and compare
solutions.

### Prompt

An example prompt or AI tool input.
