# AI Experiment: Autocomplete

## Purpose

Showcase the convenience of a smart autocomplete feature. Helps with staying in
"the flow" while writing code.

## Challenges

The autocomplete needs to be smart enough and fast enough to be useful.

## Task

Given an function signature and a couple of hints, finish the function
implementation and document it. The function implementation leads to some
repetion, however the repetition is not straightforward it can't be easily
autocompleted without an AI tool.

## Approach

Use an editor or IDE that has autocomplete functionality which is powered by
some sort of AI.

In my case (03/2025) I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with [Supermaven
plugin](https://github.com/supermaven-inc/supermaven-nvim/issues). It is fast,
integration is seamless and usually only autocompletes one line, which I'm more
comfortable with, compared to more aggressive autocompletions.

### Prompt
